**Theory:** A continuous-time signal is one that changes smoothly and
continuously across time. These signals describe a quantity of interest
that is modified by an independent variable, typically time.

A discrete-time signal is a sequence of values of interest, with the
integer index serving as a time index and the values in the sequence
representing a physical quantity of interest.

The step signal, also known as the step function, is a sort of standard
signal that exists only in positive time and is zero in negative time.
When a step signal has a magnitude of one, it is referred to as a unit
step signal or unit step function.

Except at t = 0, the amplitude of the unit impulse signal is zero. The
amplitude of the impulse signal is infinite at the origin (t = 0), hence
the area under the curve is one.

A ramp function, often known as a ramp signal, is a sort of standard
signal that begins at t = 0 and climbs linearly over time. The slop of
the unit ramp function is one unit.
